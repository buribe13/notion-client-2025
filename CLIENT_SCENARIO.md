---

## SCENARIO 1: Current State (With Pain Points)

### Day 1: Monday, 9:15 AM — Project Kickoff Email

**Olivia's Context:**

- Sitting in her office, checking email between meetings
- Has 47 unread emails
- Running late for a 9:30 AM meeting
- Just finished reviewing a contract with Alex

**Email Received:**

```
From: Alex Chen <alex@designstudio.com>
Subject: Your project dashboard is ready

Hi Olivia,

Great to start working with you! I've set up a Notion workspace for our project.
You can access it here: https://notion.so/workspace/spring-campaign-2025

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
Alex
```

**Olivia's Thoughts:**

- _"Notion? What's that? Another tool I have to learn?"_
- _"I don't have time for this right now. I'll check it later."_
- _"Do I need to sign up? Create an account? Ugh."_
- _"Why can't we just use email and Slack like normal people?"_

**Action:**

- Marks email as unread
- Moves on to next email
- Forgets about it until later

**Pain Point:** No context, no value proposition, feels like another tool to learn

---

### The Problem: Olivia's Frustration

**Olivia (marketing manager, 36) opens the Notion link her designer sent to track project progress and lands on a workspace with multiple tabs, database views, and properties she's never seen before. She clicks around but can't tell which tasks are finished, which are in progress, or what the next milestone is. Worried she might break something, she stops exploring and emails the designer saying, "Can you just tell me where things are at?" She ends the interaction feeling confused and unsure of the project's status.**

---

### Day 2: Tuesday, 2:30 PM — First Attempt to Access

**Olivia's Context:**

- Finally has 10 minutes between meetings
- Remembers Alex mentioned a dashboard
- Opens email on iPhone while walking to next meeting

**Action:** Clicks link on mobile

**Experience:**

1. **Notion Landing Page** (`notion.com`)

   - Sees: "One workspace. Zero busywork."
   - Sees: Complex embedded workspace example with "Acme Inc."
   - Sees: AI chat, multiple navigation options, overwhelming interface
   - **Thought:** _"This looks complicated. Is this even for me?"_
   - **Thought:** _"Where's my project? I don't see anything about Spring Campaign."_

2. **Use Case Selection Screen**

   - Sees: "How do you want to use Notion?"
   - Options: "For work," "For personal life," "For school"
   - **Thought:** _"None of these are right. I'm just trying to view a project."_
   - **Action:** Hesitantly selects "For work"
   - **Thought:** _"This feels wrong. I'm not using Notion for work, I'm just viewing a project."_

3. **Getting Started Page**

   - Sees: "Welcome to Notion! Ready to start building?"
   - Sees: Six lesson cards about "Workspace & sidebar," "Building with blocks," "Databases"
   - **Thought:** _"Building? Blocks? Databases? I just want to see project status."_
   - **Thought:** _"This is way too complicated. I don't have time for this."_
   - **Action:** Tries to find "Skip" button
   - **Finds:** Small "Skip" text at bottom
   - **Clicks:** Skip

4. **Project Page (Full Notion Interface)**
   - Sees: Full Notion workspace with sidebar, AI chat, multiple sections
   - Sees: Text-heavy page with blocks, databases, complex navigation
   - **Thought:** _"Where do I look? What am I supposed to do here?"_
   - **Thought:** _"I can't find what's done, what's next, or what needs my input."_
   - **Thought:** _"This is too small on my phone. I'll check it on desktop later."_
   - **Action:** Closes browser, gives up
   - **Result:** Frustrated, confused, doesn't check again

**Pain Points:**

- Overwhelming interface
- No clear entry point for project status
- Mobile experience is cluttered
- Technical jargon (blocks, databases)
- Feels like she needs to learn a new tool

---

### Day 5: Friday, 4:00 PM — Second Attempt (Desktop)

**Olivia's Context:**

- End of week, has more time
- Remembers she never checked the dashboard
- Alex sent a Slack message: "Hey, did you get a chance to review the logo concepts?"
- **Thought:** _"Oh no, I was supposed to review something? Where is it?"_

**Action:** Opens email, clicks Notion link on desktop

**Experience:**

- Goes through same onboarding flow (frustrated again)
- Finally reaches project page
- Sees: Full Notion interface, still confusing
- **Finds:** Logo concepts buried in a database view
- **Thought:** _"How do I approve these? Where do I comment?"_
- **Action:** Gives up, sends Slack message to Alex: "Can you just send me the files? I'm having trouble with Notion."

**Pain Point:** Can't figure out how to take action (approve, comment, download)

---

### Day 8: Monday, 10:00 AM — Missed Deadline

**Olivia's Context:**

- In a meeting with her team
- Alex sends urgent Slack: "Hey Olivia, we're waiting on your approval for the logo to move forward. Deadline was Friday."
- **Thought:** _"Oh no! I completely forgot. Where was I supposed to approve this?"_
- **Feels:** Stressed, embarrassed, like she let Alex down

**Action:**

- Apologizes to Alex
- Asks Alex to send files via email
- Approves via email reply
- **Result:** Inefficient workflow, missed deadline, frustration on both sides

---

## SCENARIO 2: How Notion Client Solves the Problem

### The Solution: Project Status at a Glance

**With Notion Client, Olivia never has to navigate confusing Notion workspaces or remember to check dashboards. Instead, her project status lives right on her iPhone home screen and in her Apple Wallet, updating automatically so she always knows what's done, what's next, and what needs her attention — without ever opening an app.**

## Questions This Scenario Raises

1. **What if Olivia never checks email?** → SMS notifications? Slack integration?
2. **What if she's completely tech-averse?** → Phone call option? Email-only digest?
3. **What if she has multiple projects?** → Unified dashboard? Project switcher?
4. **What if she wants to share with her team?** → Team access? Read-only view?
5. **What happens after project ends?** → Archive? Export? Transition to new project?

The solution eliminates navigation, onboarding, and the need to remember to check — project status is always visible, always up-to-date, and always accessible.**
